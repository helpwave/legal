## reasoning
For us at helpwave GmbH, a company in the Healthtech sector, making our Terms and Conditions (T&Cs) and Data Processing Agreements (DPA) public and transparent is crucial.
This transparency builds trust with our users, who need to understand how their sensitive health data will be handled and protected.
Given the stringent regulations in the health sector, such as HIPAA or GDPR, clear and accessible legal documents help ensure compliance and minimize legal risks.
Public T&Cs and DPAs outline our obligations and the rights of our users, ensuring informed consent and accountability.
This transparency also demonstrates our commitment to ethical standards and fosters a responsible, open-source community, which is vital for the growth and sustainability of our projects.
